**Date:** 2026-02-01

**Task:** PROMPT_build.md — find highest priority INCOMPLETE spec, implement, test, commit, push, output DONE.

**Result:** No INCOMPLETE spec found.

Scanned `specs/`: all numbered specs (001–032, REF) have Status "Complete" and all acceptance criteria `[x]`. No `- [ ]` in any spec. Nothing to implement this iteration.

**Action:** Exit without phrase.
