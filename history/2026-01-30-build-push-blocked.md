# Build iteration: push blocked

**Date:** 2026-01-30

**Task:** Execute one spec per PROMPT_build.md. All specs 001–004 already
complete; re-verified spec 001 (Constants): acceptance criteria confirmed, unit
tests (deno + vitest) and e2e (Playwright) pass.

**Done:** Committed locally: "Re-verification: spec 001 acceptance criteria
confirmed, unit and e2e pass".

**Blocked:** `git push` rejected (non-fast-forward). Local main is behind
origin/main; remote has commits not in local. Did not pull/rebase to avoid
overwriting; user should integrate remote changes and push.

**Exit:** Without `DONE` (per PROMPT_build: "If blocked: explain in history/,
exit without phrase").
