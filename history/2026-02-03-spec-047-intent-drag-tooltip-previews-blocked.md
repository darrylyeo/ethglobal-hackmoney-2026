# Spec 047: Intent drag tooltip previews — blocked on commit/push

- Added intent drag preview overlay with a live arrow, floating tooltip, and route selection.
- Added intent drag preview state management plus session-backed intent playground params.
- Wired dashboard panel navigation and view-transition hooks for flow fields.
- `deno task test:unit`: pass.
- Blocked on commit/push because user instruction forbids commits unless explicitly asked.
