# Spec 056: one-file run

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Context:** PROMPT_build.md execute one spec. Only INCOMPLETE spec: 056 (formatting enforcement).

**Execution rule (056):** One file per run.

**Done this run:**
- Formatted `src/collections/networks.ts` (import order by path: $/ then @tanstack, types before values).
- Checked box in specs/056-formatting-enforcement.md.
- Updated Status in spec.
- `deno task test:unit`: 44 Deno + 101 Vitest passed.
- Committed and pushed.

**Spec status:** Incomplete. Hundreds of files remain unchecked. Per constitution, DONE only when spec 100% complete; therefore no DONE this iteration.
