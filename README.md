# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by
[`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
deno run -A npm:sv create

# create a new project in my-app
deno run -A npm:sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and cached dependencies with
`deno cache --reload deno.json`, start a development server:

```sh
deno task dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
deno task dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
deno task build
```

You can preview the production build with `deno task preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an
> [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
