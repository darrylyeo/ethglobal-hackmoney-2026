# Deno only — no pnpm

- **Package manager / runner:** Use **Deno** only. Never run `pnpm`, `npm`, or `npx` for installs, scripts, or tooling in this project.
- **Commands:** Use `deno task <name>`, `deno run -A`, `deno install`, `deno test`, etc. For npm packages use `deno run -A npm:<pkg>` or the `npm:` specifier in imports as configured in deno.json.
- **Lockfile / patches:** Dependency resolution is via Deno (deno.lock, deno.json). Do not add or rely on pnpm patches, pnpm-lock.yaml, or pnpm install.
