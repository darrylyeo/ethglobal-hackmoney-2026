# Spec 002: TanStack DB collections

Use TanStack DB collections to fetch and normalize data used by the bridge UI (chains, tokens, config).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] TanStack DB is configured and used for at least one collection (e.g. chains or tokens).
- [ ] Data is fetched from a defined source (e.g. LI.FI config, static list) and normalized into collection shape.
- [ ] Collections are consumed in the app (e.g. by a Svelte component or store); not dead code.
- [ ] Vitest test(s) exist that assert collection data shape or normalization (e.g. expected keys, types).

## Status

Incomplete.

## Output when complete

` DONE `
