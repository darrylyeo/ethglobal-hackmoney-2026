# Spec 002: TanStack DB collections

Use TanStack DB collections to fetch and normalize data used by the bridge UI (chains, tokens, config).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] TanStack DB is configured and used for at least one collection (e.g. chains or tokens).
- [x] Data is fetched from a defined source (e.g. LI.FI config, static list) and normalized into collection shape.
- [x] Collections are consumed in the app (e.g. by a Svelte component or store); not dead code.
- [x] Unit test(s) exist that assert collection data shape or normalization (e.g. expected keys, types).

## Status

## Output when complete
